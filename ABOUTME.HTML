    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>The Tale of Harsh Uchiha — The Boy Who Felt EverythingTo be real with you… there isn’t some grand, flashy tale from my early life — no magical birth, no golden child spotlight.
I was just a normal boy, like a million others you see in the crowd — except I had this deep energy inside me, always curious, always active, always dreaming even if I didn’t know it yet.My school life? Honestly, it was pure rhythm and chaos mixed together. I used to wake up, head straight to school, come back, take a nap like a true desi kid, then bounce off to not one, but multiple tuitions — because that was just the flow.
After all that, I’d finally play with my best friend from the neighborhood, eat dinner, vibe for a while, and sleep.
It was nothing too extraordinary... but in its own way, it was everything.
That kind of life, though hectic, made me feel complete. Like a full loop. A loop I didn’t even realize was shaping me.But then came the instability — the real-life plot twist.Because of my dad’s unpredictable moods and personal situations, we had to shift homes almost every two years.
And when your home changes, so does everything:
 New school.
 New friends.
 New identity.
Over time, I didn’t just adapt — I evolved. I developed this strange but powerful people-reading ability.
I don’t even mean it in some fictional psychic way — nah.
It’s like I could feel people’s intentions. Who wants what from me. Who’s fake. Who’s real.
It didn’t save me from every betrayal — like falling into fake love traps (oof, pain), but it did help me dodge people who were just using me for their own gain.But let me rewind a bit — back to the sweet days of 5th grade.
That’s where my heart first caught fire.There was this girl. Coaching class.
I didn’t know what a crush even was — I was just a kid who liked when she smiled.
She used to react so sweetly when teachers praised other kids, so I decided:
“I wanna be that kid who gets praised.”
So I studied. Hard.
Not just once — I finished the syllabus twice before schedule just for that validation.
She and I talked a lot. Made plans. She promised to invite me to her birthday. I dreamed up the gift. The fun. The memories.
But when her birthday came... she didn’t show up. I waited.
I went to her house to return a book just for an excuse to see her.
She was dressed beautifully. I was smiling.
But the invite? It never came.
She just took the book. Said nothing.
I walked back home that day, and that walk hurt more than any breakup since.I was just a little boy in a toxic environment, trying to distract himself with a million hobbies.
Trying to fill the silence with noise, the tension with imagination.
And maybe because of all that, I grew up faster than usual.
I didn’t get to enjoy childhood the way I wanted.
I had to mature way earlier than a kid should — and I’m still figuring out if that’s a gift or a curse.
Maybe it’s both. Then came the Lockdown... and everything changed.While most kids were just chilling or complaining, I found myself discovering new worlds inside my own mind.There was this bhaiya living above our floor — he used to play PUBG Mobile, and the first time I saw that game, it was literally love at first sight.
I’d sneak peeks at his screen like a kid trying to glimpse into another dimension.
I couldn’t even play it — my dad had strict rules — but that didn’t stop my brain.
I imagined every moment:
 “I’ll drop here.”
 “I’ll use this gun.”
 “I’ll buy this skin.”
 All day long, my mind was living the game, even if my fingers couldn’t touch it.And of course, that was peak TikTok time too.
So yeah... I made some cringe little reels. Not even embarrassed. That’s just part of my origin story Me and one of my friends used to build our own Marvel universe — literally made ourselves Iron Man and Captain America. We’d talk for hours about it.
Reimagining movies. Rewriting stories.
That’s how my lockdown passed — not just wasting time, but reimagining the world around me. And through it all — I found games.Not just for fun. But for survival.See, my dad’s never been the “you can do it!” type.
More like, “you’re not enough, improve.”
So I grew up hungry for appreciation.
Starving for even a small “well done.”
And that’s where games stepped in.Games… they praised me.
Even if I failed, they encouraged me.
They disconnected me from reality and gave me a place where my efforts actually felt seen.
Even if I came last — they let me try again.
They’re not just a hobby.
They’re my therapy. My comfort. My escape.
Honestly? They’re my favorite hobby ever. And now?You’re looking at someone who never got a traditional childhood, but made his own universe out of struggle, imagination, and emotional intelligence.
A kid who didn’t just live through pain — but transformed it into skills, mindset, and identity.My hobby?
Making every single hobby my hobby.
Because that’s how I survive. That’s how I express. That’s how I dream.
That’s how I became Harsh Uchiha — not just a name, but a vibe, a story, a soul that’s still writing his future chapters every single day.</p>

    <h2>Family</h2>
    <p>When it comes to my family, I want to be brutally honest—no filters, no pretending. I love them unconditionally, but it’s not some perfect, fairytale kind of love. They’re my family, and while I’m grateful for everything they’ve given me, the emotional bond isn’t always simple or deep in the way people might expect. That said, I know I’m lucky in a lot of ways. I’ve had support, opportunities, and basic needs met—and for that, I’ll always carry this silent promise in my heart to repay everything they've done for me, in every possible way I can.

Let me start with my dad. My relationship with him is... complicated, to say the least. It’s kind of a rollercoaster. Some days, it feels like he loves me. Other days, it feels like he resents me—or I resent him. It’s mutual, honestly. I respect and even love him for the good things he’s done for me, the times he’s shown up. But at the same time, I struggle with how he treats my mom and sometimes even me. It’s like we’re just tolerating each other, using each other to survive. He looks at me as his ticket to a better future, especially as he gets older. And I’m not gonna lie—I lean on him too. He supports my expenses and basic needs, so yeah, it’s a weird dynamic.

That’s one big reason why I’ve always dreamed of being the best dad ever someday. I want my future kid—especially if it’s a boy—to feel the kind of love I never fully got. Not just words, but actual love. Real support, understanding, time, warmth. I want to be a safe space for my child, not a source of confusion or fear.

Now, about my mom—I’ve got a lot of mixed feelings there too. I love her, I respect her, and I appreciate everything she’s done for us. She’s strong in her own way, but I hate seeing her take the side of someone who doesn’t treat her well. Sometimes I get mad, thinking “Why is she still putting up with this?” But deep down, I understand. Maybe she stays because she feels like there’s no other option—especially with us kids depending on her. That hurts to accept, but I get it. Still, I don’t talk to my mom or dad much. Not because I don’t care, but because I just can’t handle the emotional weight of those relationships all the time.

Then there are my sisters. I’m not super emotionally attached to them, but they’ve always shown me love in their own way. And that doesn’t go unnoticed. I really want to repay that love by being there for them—especially the younger ones. The youngest one, man... she’s got attitude and ego for days, lol. A whole queen in her own mind. 👑 And the middle one? She’s kinda scary when she’s mad—not gonna lie. Push her too far and she might just throw hands. But still, I’ve got love for both of them. And I’ve got more sisters beyond them, and I treat them all with the same respect and care.

I know I’m not the perfect son or brother. Honestly, I feel like I’m just figuring it all out as I go, carrying emotional weight I don’t always talk about. But what I do know is this: one day, I want to build a future that’s different from the one I came from. A future full of love, peace, and respect—the kind I crave now. And I’m willing to work hard, learn, grow, and hustle until I get there.

That’s my truth—for now, at least. </p>

    <h2>Love</h2>
    <p>"So let’s start from the beginning.
It was a rainy day — like heavy heavy rain, and I got a little soaked in it. That day, most of the kids from my class hadn’t shown up, so I ended up sitting somewhere else, in a different spot. And that’s when the whole damn thing started...

A girl came up to me and said, “This is my seat. Move.”
And I was like, “Is your name written on it or what?”
And she straight-up said, “Yeah, it is.” 💀

We got into this mini argument, all sassy and savage. But eventually, she sat on the desk next to mine. And bro, I don’t even know what happened, but I started feeling some kind of way. Like there was this instant vibe — attraction, connection, curiosity, something.

That day we talked a lot — mostly arguing and messing around, but in the middle of that chaos, I got interested in her. Then, during the conversation, she casually told me that she had 4 or 5 exes and was currently dating someone.

And I was like: "BRO WTF 😵‍💫💔?? Her standards, man — they were wild. I was lowkey impressed, not gonna lie.

Then I ended up telling her about my own pain — about my first ever proposal and the story behind it (which I’ll share in detail later). But after that day, things kept moving.

Days went by, and I just kept falling for her — more and more.
And you know what the crazy part is? I started removing all her red flags from the scene — like all her crushes or flings in school — I got rid of them using some seriously mastermind tactics 🧠💣

For around 3 months straight, I was in full ‘lover boy simp mode’.
Always around her.
Always thinking about her.
Planning new ways to impress her.
Bro, I was obsessed. Straight-up maniac mode 😭❤️
And sorry this story is not somplete and it have to complete it is only 10 percent and many things are mixed up but that is ai genereted as uk for my behaviou </p>
