    <h2>UR BEAUTY </h2>
    <p>I’ve probably told you a thousand times how beautiful you are, but I still feel like the words fall short. You’re not just beautiful in the way people usually say it—you’re beautiful in the kind of way that makes time slow down. When I see your face, it’s not just something I look at—it’s something I feel. There’s peace in your expression, softness in your smile, and magic in your eyes. And I swear, sometimes I see the reflection of the sun itself in them. That sparkle… it’s mesmerizing. Your face looks like it belongs in a dream, and your vibe? It feels like home. I don’t know what I did right to have you in my life, but I’ll never take it for granted. You could’ve been anywhere, with anyone, being admired by the world, but somehow, fate chose me to be the one who gets to know you, talk to you, and love you. And I promise I’ll spend my life proving I’m worthy of that. You’re the first person I want to talk to when something good happens, and the only one I need when I’m down. You’ve become the center of my peace without even trying.</p>

    <h2>Shoulders</h2>
    <p>And I remember when you told me you were insecure about your shoulders. That moment stayed with me because I realized how much I never want you to feel that way—not for one second. I made a silent promise that when I finally meet you, I’ll kiss those shoulders first—not just as a romantic gesture, but to show you how perfect they are to me, how perfect you are to me. I don’t care what the world says or what standards exist out there—you, just the way you are, set the only standard I believe in. Your body, your face, your features, your energy—everything is perfect to me. You’re not too much or too little—you’re balanced like art. You’re not skinny, not curvy—you’re you. And that’s exactly what I love. Even the things you think are flaws? To me, they’re your most beautiful parts. They make you real. Human. Honest. And I don’t want a perfect image. I want you.</p>

    <h2>Your Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Your hobbies? I admire them so much. The way you play piano, even when you think you're not good at it, sounds like music made out of effort and heart. You might think it’s messy, but to me, it’s the most beautiful melody. You could hit random keys and I’d still sit there smiling like a fool, proud of you. Your dedication, your passion—even in things you’re still learning—makes you ten times more attractive. And the way you ride horses, girl… that’s some boss-level energy right there. It was once a male-dominated thing, and here you are, breaking that with elegance and strength. And boxing? Let’s not even start, because that’s straight-up fire. It takes guts, power, and discipline—and you’ve got all of it. Honestly, I feel like I’m dating a literal goddess with the hobbies of a superhero.</p>

    <h2>Just U</h2>
    <p>And yeah, I know you overthink sometimes. I do too. I know there are moments when you feel like you’re not enough. But let me tell you, from the deepest core of my heart—you’re more than enough. You’re everything. I don’t just love you in spite of those thoughts—I love you with them. I love every crack, every chaotic moment, every overthinking spiral—because it all comes from you, and I wouldn’t change a thing. You inspire me. You make me want to become the best version of myself—not out of pressure, but because I want to be better for you. Sometimes I wonder if I even deserve you, and then I remind myself: I don’t want to just deserve you—I want to earn you, every single day. You treat me with so much love, so much care, it honestly feels like I’m lying in my mother’s arms again—safe, protected, loved deeply. That’s what you are to me. You’re comfort. You’re calm in the chaos. You’re the soft voice when the world is loud. You’re everything I never thought I’d find.</p>

    <h2>Final</h2>
    <p>And I know this world can be cruel to people like you—pure souls, kind hearts, shining lights. But I swear on everything, I’ll be the one who makes you feel seen, valued, loved, protected. If the whole world tries to dim your light, I’ll be the one shielding you with both hands, lighting you up again. Your presence in my life is more than a blessing—it’s a whole transformation. And even if everything else disappears—this world, me, time itself—I just want you to know one truth: I love you. I love you endlessly. I love you through every version of yourself. I love you when you feel strong and when you feel weak. I love you when you're sure of yourself and when you're lost. I love your hair, your eyes, your waist, your smile, your soul, your hobbies, your imperfections, and everything in between. There’s not a single thing I’d change. I love you a thousand times over. I know it sounds like I’m spamming the words, but I’m doing it to make sure you feel every single syllable.

You’re not just a flower in my garden, you're the only flower. And I’m the gardener who promises to protect you from every storm. I don’t want another. I won’t grow another. You’re it. You always were.

Forever yours,
Harsh Uchiha 🖤</p>
